# Lost Cities

A Java-based strategy board game inspired by the Minoan civilization, developed for the HY252 course at the University of Crete.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This game recreates the archaeological exploration of four legendary Minoan palaces — Knossos, Phaistos, Malia, and Zakros. Two players compete by moving pawns along 4 distinct paths, collecting rare findings, and using special cards while adhering to strategic rules.
